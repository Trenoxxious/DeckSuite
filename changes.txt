- Fixed an issue where player models in the 3D portrait would refresh too often.
- Adjustments to target frames depending on classification, health levels, trivialness, etc.
- Made in-combat player frame less jarring in color.
- Added a settings frame using Ace3 Config (ty Ace3) for adjusting various settings. Currently we have a setting to adjust unit frame center offset and to enable Ultra Hardcore unit frames.
